        <p id="paragraph-one">I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2006 and have been been working in the Oil and Gas service industry since. I currenlty hold the title of Technical Advisor and Lab Supervisor for the 
        Reservoir Fluids group. The oil industry has afforded me many opportunities. I have traveled all over the US and the world
        performing a job that I loved.  My favorite places that I've traveled to for work include: Scotland, Alaska, Canada. My favorite parts of the job have been meeting and collaborating with individuals from all over the world and training new laboratory and field technicians.
        </p>
        <p>Over the last 5 years my life has changed drastically and for the better.  I married the love of my life and we quickly grew our family. As one of my favorite Garth Brooks' songs goes, "We are two of a 
        kind, working on a full house." I am blessed to have three beautiful boys between the ages of 1 and 3. Never the less my house is always noisy and there's plenty of toys on the floor.  I wouldn't have it any other way.
        </p>
        <p>My hobbies include playing video games, buying upgrades for my truck, spending time with family, and watching movies. My favorite sports teams are the Houston Astros, Houston Rockets and the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
